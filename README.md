# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project-World-Sakila-Databases

This project contains SQL-based analysis performed on two popular sample databases:

World Database – Country, city, and population-related data

Sakila Database – Movie rental store database with customers, rentals, payments, and stores

The objective of this assignment was to apply SQL queries to solve real-world style data analysis problems involving aggregation, grouping, sorting, filtering, joins, and business insights.

🎯 Objectives of the Assignment

Through this assignment, I worked on:

Analyzing population data at country and city levels

Understanding customer behavior and rental trends

Performing revenue analysis

Extracting business insights using SQL

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

SQL

Relational Databases:

World Database

Sakila Database

📊 Problems Solved
🌍 World Database Analysis

1️⃣ Country with Maximum Population
Used sorting and aggregate functions to identify the most populated country.

2️⃣ Total Population of Cities per Country
Applied GROUP BY with SUM() to calculate combined city populations for each country.

3️⃣ Top 3 Countries by Population Density
Calculated population density using a derived formula:

Population Density = Population / Surface Area

Then ranked countries to find the top 3.

🎬 Sakila Database Analysis

4️⃣ Customer with the Highest Number of Rentals
Used joins and grouping to identify the most active customer.

5️⃣ Month with the Most Rentals
Extracted month from rental dates and aggregated rental counts.

6️⃣ Total Revenue Generated Per Day
Summed daily payments to analyze revenue trends.

7️⃣ Store with the Highest Total Revenue
Joined store, rental, and payment tables to compare store performance.

8️⃣ Customers Who Made Exactly 5 Payments
Used GROUP BY and HAVING to filter customers based on payment count.

🧠 Key SQL Concepts Practiced

This assignment strengthened my understanding of:

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY

GROUP BY and HAVING

Aggregate functions:

SUM()

COUNT()

MAX()

Table joins

Date functions (extracting month, grouping by date)

Derived calculations (like population density)

Business-oriented querying

📈 Analytical Skills Developed

Through this project, I learned how to:

Convert real-world business questions into SQL queries

Analyze structured data from multiple tables

Work with large datasets using grouping and aggregation

Identify trends, top performers, and performance metrics

Interpret SQL output in a business context

💡 Key Takeaways

SQL is powerful for extracting meaningful insights from raw data

Proper use of grouping and aggregation helps in summarizing large datasets

Business questions often require combining multiple tables

Even simple queries can provide important decision-making insights

🎓 What I Learned from This Assignment

How to analyze population statistics and perform density calculations

How to evaluate customer activity in a rental system

How to track revenue patterns over time

How businesses can use SQL for performance analysis

How to write structured and optimized queries

🚀 Conclusion

This assignment helped me bridge the gap between SQL theory and practical data analysis. By working with realistic databases like World and Sakila, I improved my ability to write efficient SQL queries and derive insights that are useful in real business scenarios.

This project reflects my growing skills in SQL, data analysis, and problem-solving as I prepare for a data analyst role.
